# OpenFlexFuel

This is a small project I started to convert my Honda Accord (CH7) to E85.  
The plan is to integrate a small pcb module into the ECU instead of piggybacking wires under the hood.  

There will be a small I2C oled module to monitor duty cycle, fuel ethanol content and possible water contamination.
